# OPTIMAC a tool to reduce the pretty effects for performance. (Modified for University Lab Optimization)

OptiMac will optimize device by doing the following:

  - Remove any trace of "Inventory_Update" scripts (Which I still don't know what it does.)

  - Remove all User accounts that start with 00... Anything else will need manual removal.

  - Reduces Taskbar Icons (iBooks, iTunes, and Photos still show for some reason.)

  - Disables Mac Animations

Device will need to be rebooted after script has ran.




<b>HOW TO RUN SCRIPT!</b>

 1. Move OptiMac folder from USB to desktop.
 2. Navigate to script's location in Terminal.
	Ex. ~/Desktop/iMac\ Scripts/
 3. Type "sudo bash ./OptiMac.sh" then press enter.
 4. Type password then let it do its THANG!
 4a. You may use EMPTY_THE_TRASH script if you are sure you want to delete everything.
 5. Reboot device for changes to apply.


<b>TO REANIMATE MAC</b>

To bring all Mac animations back. Run the ReAnimate_Mac.sh script.
