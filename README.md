# OPTIMAC a tool to reduce the pretty effects for performance. (Modified for University Lab Optimization)

OptiMac will optimize device by doing the following:

  - Remove any trace of "Inventory_Update" scripts (Which I still don't know what it does.)

  - Remove all User accounts that start with 00... Anything else will need manual removal.

  - Reduces Taskbar Icons (iBooks, iTunes, and Photos still show for some reason.)

  - Disables Mac Animations

Device will need to be rebooted after script has ran.




HOW TO RUN SCRIPT!

 1. Move OptiMac folder from USB to desktop.
 2. Navigate to script's location in Terminal.
	Ex. ~/Desktop/iMac\ Scripts/
 3. Type "sudo bash ./OptiMac.sh" then press enter.
 4. Type password then let it do its THANG!
 4a. You may use EMPTY_THE_TRASH script if you are sure you want to delete everything.
 5. Reboot device for changes to apply.


TO REANIMATE MAC

To bring all Mac animations back. Run the ReAnimate_Mac.sh script.
